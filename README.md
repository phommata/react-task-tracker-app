# React Baseline Frontend Assessment

## What You’ll Be Making

Provided in the Codesandbox is the shell of a very basic Task Tracker application. You’ll notice that the React code is written in Typescript. If you’re not familiar with Typescript, don’t worry, we’ve already provided all the types you’ll need during the assessment so that you can focus on just the React code.
The existing components in the assessment shell are there as a guide, but you can do anything you like to make the tests pass as long as you use React functional components and hooks when necessary.
Codesandbox has a built in test runner that you can use to track your progress through the assessment. There will be ordered comments in the code that will indicate the recommended steps to complete the exercise.

## Outcomes

A successful completion of the assessment will demonstrate:

1. A solid baseline proficiency in React
2. Some exposure to working in Test Driven Development

## What You’ll Need to Succeed

- Experience with functional components in React.
- Some familiarity with React hooks (useState in particular)
- Knowledge of how to pass props to child components

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes, the in-browser Test runner for Codesandbox will fail even though it shouldn’t...
If you run into failing tests for what seems like no good reason:

1. SAVE your progress, then
2. REFRESH your browser and try running the tests again.
